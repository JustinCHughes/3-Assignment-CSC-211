Chapter 4:

1)

!(a > b) --- (a <= b)
!(a <= b && c <= d) --- (a > b) && (c > d)
!(a + 1 == b + 1) --- (a + 1 != b + 1)
!(a < 1 || b < 2 && c < 3) --- (a >= 1 || ((b >= 2) && (c >= 3))

2)

a > b && c < d --- !(a <= b) && !(c>=d) --- false
a < ! b || !!a
a + b < !c + c
a - x || b * c && b / a

Errors:
	- i is set to = 2 instead of == so it is not checking for equivalency
	- i is initialized with a value before it arrives at the conditional, but
		this could be implied as happening within the ......
	- if i is not initialized before the conditional, this would cause an error
		if it was actually checking for equivalency "=="
	- Commentary below is if the "=" was "==" and assuming i was initialized

The first code uses a while loop which will continue to loop as long as i == 2.
Assuming i == 2 to start the while loop, i is then set to 0 so that it doesn't become
and infinite loop. During the one iteration of the while loop, it will print out
some even numbers. Caveat - if it remained as is with i = 2, it could cause an
infinite loop.

The second set of code uses an if statement where if i == 2 the function will
print out some even numbers. Caveat - if it remained i = 2, it would always
print out the even numbers.

I'm surprised that the fourth option came up as "0" representing false. However,
I assume that this has to do with the number being too large and thus the small
0.001 is not being factored in when doing the comparison.

Only the plast printf statement gets pritned outputting 7. This is because of
the lack of brackets being used. The else statement is assumed by the computer
to be attached to the second if statement is not activated by the first if
statement coming up as false. Using brackets would fix this issue so that only
the second if statement is nested within the if stateent. The final print
statement is not subject to the first if statement is printed regardless of
any conditionals.

Compilation error listed below. The problems I see here are as follows:
	- variable i was never initialized with a type or value
	- a do while loop requires that the do statement comes first
		and the while loop is at the end after the logic of
		what is being done is completed
	- variable j is never initialized with a type

Compilation error:

Thought process:
- Both values being negative causes it to immediately terminate
- One value must be negative and remain negative
- It is not possible for i or j to remain at 7 or 9
- Incrementing will eventually lead to i and j both being positive
	thus being positive

I cannot think of a way to create an infinite loop with this conditional.
